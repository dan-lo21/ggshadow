## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.0.0
* local ubuntu, R 3.6.3
* Windows (https://win-builder.r-project.org), R-devel

## R CMD check results

* There were no ERRORs, no WARNINGs and no NOTEs on local builds.
* 1 note about possible misspelled words (Geoms and steampunk) in the description on win-builder.
  I think this is fine.
