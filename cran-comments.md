## Bug fixes
This is a small fix to support the next version of `ggplot2`.
The function `new_data_frame` was removed from `ggplot2`. It was replaced by an equivalent function 
from from `vctrs`.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.2.1
* local ubuntu, R 3.6.3
* Windows (https://win-builder.r-project.org), R-devel

## R CMD check results

* There were no ERRORs, no WARNINGs and no NOTEs.
